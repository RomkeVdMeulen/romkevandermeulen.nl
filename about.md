title: About me
---
I am a young programmer from Groningen, The Netherlands. I care deeply about
learning new things and enjoy passing that knowledge on in a form that enables
others to use it. I love making easy-to-use tools that support people in
creating great things, and help them to write and tell the stories of their own
lives.

Our world is changing ever more quickly. Interaction between people and machines
is becoming more common. Devices need to become better at interacting with human
beings, rather than the other way around. And if they are to interact with us
naturally, machines must learn to understand the world around us. Our interaction
with the digital world will one day overlap seamlessly with our interaction with
the physical world, of that I have no doubt. We've come so very far in the last
few decades, and we have so much further to go still.
