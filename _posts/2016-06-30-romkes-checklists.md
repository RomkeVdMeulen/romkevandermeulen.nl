excerpt:
  I've released a very simple webapp that has some checklists I find useful.
  I started it off with a checklist to go through before committing code.

I was working on committing some code when I realized that there's a large
number of steps I have to go through to make sure my commit is correct, some of
which are easily forgotten. So I made a simple webapp with a checklist and space
for notes to help me work on my commit. I'm calling it
[Romke's Checklists](http://checklists.romkevandermeulen.nl). Like I explain on
that page, I'm releasing it publicly because a) it makes it easier for myself to
get a hold of it when I need it and b) somebody might have some use for it. Note
though that I'm not offering any guarantees that my commit checklist will cover
all the needs for your workflow: use it wisely. Of course, if you have any
suggestions, I'm open to issues and PR's on the
[the Github page for the app](https://github.com/RomkeVdMeulen/checklists).

If I find a use for any other checklists in the future, I'll add them to the app.
