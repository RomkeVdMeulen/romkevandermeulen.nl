I happened to come across this fine article today:
"[What Technology Should My Startup Use?](http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2013/08/27/what-technology-should-my-startup-use/)"
by [Matt Aimonetti](http://matt.aimonetti.net/).

C#, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby... With so many programming languages around I, like
many others, have asked myself which one to use where. An experienced programmer
can build great applications in almost any language. Most modern programming
languages are more alike than different. So the question of which language to
use becomes less about the structure and features of the language and more about
the design philosophies, infrastructure and communities behind them. Matt gives,
as far as I can tell, an accurate portrayal of the 'atmosphere' surrounding many
modern languages. Though his focus is on startups, the information is also
useful for a developer looking which skills to develop. Good high-level 
descriptions of the programmer landscape are difficult to come by in my
experience, so I highly recommend you read this article.
