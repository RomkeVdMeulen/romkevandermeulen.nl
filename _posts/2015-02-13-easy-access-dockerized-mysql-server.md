Deploying a new mysql server using Docker is quite easy:

```shell
docker run --name mysql mariadb
```

But once the server is up, you want root access to it from your command-line.
The [mariadb repo](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) shows an example
of how to do this. I've wrapped their command in a little shellÂ function that
you can add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`. If you call the function without
arguments, it will drop you on the mysql prompt. If you give a mysql command as
argument, it will execute it as mysql root and show the result.

Here's how it works:

    # mysqlroot "SHOW DATABASES"
    Database
    my_db_1
    my_db_2

    # mysqlroot
    MariaDB [(none)]>

## Bonus round: automated backup
