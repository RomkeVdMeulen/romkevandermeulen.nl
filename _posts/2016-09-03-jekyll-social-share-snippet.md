To set up this blog, I wrote a snippet of Jekyll template code (Liquid) to
create social share links. You can find it
[on Github](https://github.com/RomkeVdMeulen/jekyll-share-links) if you're
interested.

I did find a few other implementations of this, but some of them were out of
date while others needlessly used JavaScript to set the URLs even though Jekyll
can just bake them in for you.
