In this article I will demonstrate a setup using
[Docker](http://www.docker.com),
[docker-gen](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen) and
[nginx](http://nginx.org/en/)
that will add new Docker containers to nginx automatically as an upstream
instruction, but still let you manually configure how these containers are
publicly served by writing the site instructions yourself.

----

## Background
In [an earlier article]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015/01/31/dokku-docker-server-power-control/ "Dokku and Docker on the same server: power and control")
I set up my server with Docker and [Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku).
One of the things I showed is how to deploy Docker containers on your server and
serve them on a specific URL by using nginx as a reverse proxy. I automated this
by using docker-gen. Docker-gen watches your Docker containers, and
automatically generates nginx config when new containers are deployed or taken
down. I used a [config template](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy/blob/master/nginx.tmpl)
from [jwilder](https://github.com/jwilder)'s [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) 
container, which works pretty simply: you set an environmental `VIRTUAL_HOST` on
your container, and docker-gen creates all the necessary nginx config to host
your container on this URL. For example:

```shell
docker run \
       -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=foo -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=bar \
       -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=foo -e VIRTUAL_HOST=blog.foo.com \
       --link mysql:mysql --restart=always wordpress
```

This command is all you need to run (provided you've already set up your
database of course) to deploy a new Wordpress blog and serve it on blog.foo.com.
However, after having used this process a number of times, I found that it has a
couple of drawbacks:

* I can't change the URL my container is hosted at: I have to destroy and
re-create the container with a different `VIRTUAL_HOST` value
* I can't configure nginx for individual containers: every rule I add has to
go into my configuration template and is then applied to every nginx site that
docker-gen generates

Fortunately, there is a simple solution for this. The nginx config generated by
this template consists of two components: an upstream and a site. The simple
solution then is to have docker-gen generate the upstream instructions, but
write the site by hand. This method is flexible enough to deal with the
container's randomly assigned IP address yet still allows you to configure your
site any way you want. Here is the new way to deploy a Wordpress blog. I create
a Wordpress container and give it a new environmental: `NGINX_UPSTREAM` rather
than `VIRTUAL_HOST`:

```shell
docker run \
       -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=foo -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=bar \
       -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=foo -e NGINX_UPSTREAM=fooblog \
       --name fooblogcontainer --link mysql:mysql \
       --restart=always wordpress
```

docker-gen automatically updates the config file
`/etc/nginx/conf.d/docker_upstream_hosts.conf`:

```conf
upstream fooblog {
        # fooblogcontainer
        server 172.17.0.42:80;
}
```

Now I write the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/com.foo.blog` by hand:

```conf
server {
        server_name blog.foo.com;

        access_log  /var/log/nginx/com.foo.blog_access.log;
        error_log   /var/log/nginx/com.foo.blog_error.log notice;

        include global/restrictions.conf;
        include global/wordpress.conf;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://fooblog;
        }
}
```

I link to this new file from `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` and then reload nginx.
Now my new Wordpress site is available at blog.foo.com. Yes, it is more work
than simply starting the container with `VIRTUAL_HOST=blog.foo.com` to begin
with, but this way allows me to apply additional nginx configuration that
applies to Wordpress blogs but no other web applications. The two included files
for example are config files with additional security rules and additional
Wordpress rules respectively. You want this, right? Otherwise you wouldn't still
be reading this. Don't worry! I'm going to show you how I did it.

## Setup

### VIRTUAL_HOST

I wanted to keep the old setup that triggers on `VIRTUAL_HOST` as well as the
new mechanism, so I moved around some files. I kept the docker-gen executable in
`/etc/nginx/docker-gen` (see [my previous article]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015/01/31/dokku-docker-server-power-control/ "Dokku and Docker on the same server: power and control")).
I moved the config template (which is a straightforward copy of
[jwilder's nginx-proxy template](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy/blob/master/nginx.tmpl))
to `/etc/nginx/docker-gen-vhost-template`. The command that runs docker-gen with
this template is embedded in a script at `/etc/nginx/docker-gen-vhost-service`
with this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/etc/nginx/docker-gen -only-exposed -watch -notify "service nginx reload" \
      /etc/nginx/docker-gen-vhost-template \
      /etc/nginx/sites-available/docker_virtual_hosts
```

I put the output config file in `sites-available` and link to it from
`sites-enabled` so that I can disable auto-generated site config if needed. Now
I make an upstart job for this script (feel free to use another service manager)
in `/etc/init/docker-virtualhosts.conf`:

```conf
# docker-virtualhosts - Nginx config generator for Docker containers
# using the VIRTUAL_HOST env

description "Nginx vhost config generator for Docker containers"
author "Sombody <sombody@foo.com>"

start on filesystem and started docker
stop on runlevel [016]
respawn
console log

pre-start script
    [ -d /etc/nginx/certs ] || mkdir -p /etc/nginx/certs
end script

exec /etc/nginx/docker-gen-vhost-service
```

Now I simply run `initctl start docker-virtualhosts` and my config generator
service is up.

## NGINX_UPSTREAM

The setup that triggers on `NGINX_UPSTREAM` is even simpler. I wrote this config
template to `/etc/nginx/docker-gen-upstream-template`:

{% raw %}
    {{ range $host, $containers := groupByMulti $ "Env.NGINX_UPSTREAM" "," }}

    upstream {{ $host }} {
        {{ range $container := $containers }}
            {{ $addrLen := len $container.Addresses }}
            {{/* If only 1 port exposed, use that */}}
            {{ if eq $addrLen 1 }}
                    {{ with $address := index $container.Addresses 0 }}
                       # {{$container.Name}}
                       server {{ $address.IP }}:{{ $address.Port }};
                    {{ end }}
            {{/* If more than one port exposed, */}}
            {{/* use the one matching VIRTUAL_PORT env var */}}
            {{ else if $container.Env.VIRTUAL_PORT }}
                    {{ range $address := .Addresses }}
                       {{ if eq $address.Port $container.Env.VIRTUAL_PORT }}
                       # {{$container.Name}}
                       server {{ $address.IP }}:{{ $address.Port }};
                       {{ end }}
                    {{ end }}
            {{/* Else default to standard web port 80 */}}
            {{ else }}
                    {{ range $address := $container.Addresses }}
                            {{ if eq $address.Port "80" }}
                            # {{$container.Name}}
                            server {{ $address.IP }}:{{ $address.Port }};
                            {{ end }}
                    {{ end }}
            {{ end }}
        {{ end }}
    }

    {{ end }}
{% endraw %}

Then I wrote the script `/etc/nginx/docker-gen-upstream-service`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/etc/nginx/docker-gen -only-exposed -watch -notify "service nginx reload" \
      /etc/nginx/docker-gen-upstream-template \
      /etc/nginx/conf.d/docker_upstream_hosts.conf
```

And created an upstart job in `/etc/init/docker-upstreams.conf` exactly like the
last one but executing `/etc/nginx/docker-gen-upstream-service`. The output
config file `/etc/nginx/conf.d/docker_upstream_hosts.conf` is loaded by default
by nginx, so I can reference the generated upstreams from my hand-written site
instructions like I've shown you. In case you're curious, the additional config
files I used in my site example look like this:
`/etc/nginx/global/restrictions.conf`:

```conf
# Global restrictions configuration file.
# Designed to be included in any server {} block.
location = /favicon.ico {
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
}

location = /robots.txt {
        allow all;
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
}

# Deny all attempts to access hidden files such as .htaccess, .DS_Store (Mac).
# Keep logging the requests to parse later
location ~ /\. {
        deny all;
}
```

And `/etc/nginx/global/wordpress.conf`:

```conf
# Deny access to any files with a .php extension in the uploads directory
# Works in sub-directory installs and also in multisite network
# Keep logging the requests to parse later
location ~* /(?:uploads|files)/.*\.php$ {
   deny all;
}

client_max_body_size 8M;
```

You may also want to include the `restrictions.conf` file in your `VIRTUAL_HOST`
config template as well. So, if you've been following along with this tutorial,
you should have these files:

    /etc/init/docker-virtualhosts.conf
    /etc/init/docker-upstreams.conf
    /etc/nginx/docker-gen
    /etc/nginx/docker-gen-upstream-service
    /etc/nginx/docker-gen-upstream-template
    /etc/nginx/docker-gen-vhost-service
    /etc/nginx/docker-gen-vhost-template
    /etc/nginx/global/restrictions.conf
    /etc/nginx/global/wordpress.conf
    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/docker_virtual_hosts
       -> /etc/nginx/sites-available/docker_virtual_hosts

These files should be generated automatically:

    /etc/nginx/conf.d/docker_upstream_hosts.conf
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/docker_virtual_hosts

And to deploy blog.foo.com you should write
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/com.foo.blog` and link to it from
`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`.
